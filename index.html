        <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
        <p>
            In this two-player dice game, each player competes to reach a total score of 100. The order of play is determined when someone clicks the "New Game" button. During a player's turn, they can roll the dice as many times as they wish, with each roll adding the dice value (from 1 to 6) to their current score. Players must decide whether to continue rolling or to "Hold" by clicking the hold button, which transfers their current score to their total score. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their accumulated current score and their turn ends immediately. The first player to achieve a total score of 100 wins the game.
